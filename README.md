Initial push to github with working files and backup files. The directory 'trial' was the first attempt of the website
and still has good information in it that I will refer back to from time to time. 

Public is where the Class files are being held as well as the CSS and header and footer files.

All the other files are currently in the root directory. Although we will be be keeping track of images in the database,
we will not be tracking them in the repository.
