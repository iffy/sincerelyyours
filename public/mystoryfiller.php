	During the summer of 2014 I decided that I needed to write my stories down before I started to forget them or
	before they grew out of proportion.<br><br>

	I fully intended to publish these stories in a book and get them distributed as gifts to family and friends. To my  
	dismay I found that publishing a book is expensive, costing me money I did not have at the time.<br><br>

	This website grew out of that need. It allows you to write your stories and publish them for free. They can be 
	written in whatever word processor you choose and then you cut and paste them into this site. You are able to 
	generate a list of guests with whom you wish to share these stories. Each story can be shared with a different 
	set of guests, it is up to you to choose. Each story can have an image associated with the story, and soon multiple 
	images will be allowed. As you save each story you will be able to choose to send the story or save it for further 
	revision; but once you have completed your story you can send an email to your guests inviting them to come to the 
	website and read the stories you have written. It will be left up to you to decide if you would like feedback in the 
	form of comments on your stories, but that option is available.<br><br>
